# Electric Vehicle Charger Project
This project uses an API to nobil.no to collect data on electric vehicle chargers  
the API is free to use, you just have to apply [here](https://info.nobil.no/api) to get the key.

We use a .env file to ensure that the API key does not go public. But if you are  
interested in what data is available you can use this client test of the api [here](https://www.nobil.no/api/client/search_apiVer3.php).  

More info to come on what the project does and how to run it.
